- Add Loopback support 

## 1.5.0

- **MAJOR UPDATE**: Added 5 new layout algorithms
    - BalloonLayoutAlgorithm: Radial tree layout with circular child arrangements around parents
    - CircleLayoutAlgorithm: Arranges nodes in circular formations with edge crossing reduction
    - RadialTreeLayoutAlgorithm: Converts tree structures to polar coordinate system
    - TidierTreeLayoutAlgorithm: Improved tree layout with better spacing and positioning
    - MindmapAlgorithm: Specialized layout for mindmap-style distributions
- **NEW**: Node expand/collapse functionality with GraphViewController
    - `collapseNode()`, `expandNode()`, `toggleNodeExpanded()` methods
    - Hierarchical visibility control with animated transitions
    - Initial collapsed state support via `setInitiallyCollapsedNodes()`
- **NEW**: Advanced animation system
    - Smooth expand/collapse animations with customizable duration
    - Node scaling and opacity transitions during state changes
    - `toggleAnimationDuration` parameter for fine-tuning animations
- **NEW**: Enhanced GraphView.builder constructor
    - `animated`: Enable/disable smooth animations (default: true)
    - `autoZoomToFit`: Automatically zoom to fit all nodes on initialization
    - `initialNode`: Jump to specific node on startup
    - `panAnimationDuration`: Customizable navigation movement timing
    - `centerGraph`: Center the graph within viewport having a fixed large size of 2000000
    - `controller`: GraphViewController for programmatic control
- **NEW**: Navigation and pan control features
    - `jumpToNode()` and `animateToNode()` for programmatic navigation
    - `zoomToFit()` for automatic viewport adjustment
    - `resetView()` for returning to origin
    - `forceRecalculation()` for layout updates
- **IMPROVED** TreeEdgeRenderer with curved/straight connection options
- **IMPROVED**: Better performance with caching for graphs
- **IMPROVED**: Sugiyama Algorithm with postStraighten and additional strategies
